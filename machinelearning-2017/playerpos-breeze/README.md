# Machinelearning using [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze)

Tryed to apply linear regerssion with a bunch of
different hypothesis dinctions on the vsoc playerpos dataset.
 
## Results
Did not really get results as the trained models did ever predict any of the trained values.

## Tryout
Inside the 'tryout' package I have tryed to find parameters for polinomial functions in order to see
if I am doing something completely wrong. To find the original worked fine.

## Conclution
Breeze seems to be too low level to solve these kinds of problems.
