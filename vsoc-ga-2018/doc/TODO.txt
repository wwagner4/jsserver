- F fitness function

- N Neural Net

OBSOLETE ??
- make the crossover per player and not per team: C0
- F fitness function
-- C hitting the ball with zero kick power must not be rewarded.
     Is avoided by other fitness functions.


DONE
- M0 try a multilayer net
     SUCCESS
- M1 use sigmoid instead of tanh
     SUCCESS
- adapt fitness weights:
-- G0 less for a goal:
      NO CHANGE replaced by FB
-- K0 less for kickout in relation to kick
      NO CHANGE seems to be not relevant
- F fitness function
-- A if more than one player hits the ball must be rewarded. Avoid breeding teams with only one 'real' player
-- B goal must be rewarded relative to number of kicks. E.g. any goal doubles the fitness of the kicks
- Anayse the normal outputvalues to find out how to adjust input/output values
