LEARNING
- try a multilayer net: M0
- use sigmoid instead of tanh M1
- adapt fitness weights:
-- less for a goal: G0
-- less for kickout in relation to kick K0
- make the crossover per player and not per team: C0

- fitness function
-- hitting the ball with zero kick power must not be rewarded
-- if more than one player hits the ball must be rewarded. Avoid breeding teams with only one 'real' player
-- goal must be rewarded relative to number of kicks. E.g. any goal doubles the fitness of the kicks


ANALYSE
- OK Anayse the normal outputvalues to find out how to adjust input/output values
